# Code for object and face detection with a webcam and a Raspeberry pi

The repository contains Python code for face detection, object recognition and other machine learning application using a webcam.
A part of the demos are made to run on a Raspberry Pi (3 or 4).

It uses several open-source libraries where neural networks have already been pre-trained for the task at hand.

* Simple face detection and recognition uses opencv library.
* Face detection with gender, age and emotion recognition is DeepFace code : [https://github.com/serengil/deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface)
